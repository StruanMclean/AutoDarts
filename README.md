# AutoDarts
Automatic dart scoring system with detection 2 and opencv

I have uploaded my code since I am finished with this project for now.

To run you will need to make a frontend ui which connects to the FastAPI websocket.

You will also need to train a ai model with detectron 2 I will include the training code.

AI training code is in autodarts_training.ipynb.
