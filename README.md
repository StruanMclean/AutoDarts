# AutoDarts
Automatic dart scoring system with detection 2 and opencv

I have uploaded my code since I am finished with this project for now.

To run you will need to make a frontend ui which connects to the FastAPI websocket.

You will also need to train a ai model with detectron 2 I will include the training code.
I have an AI model pretrained but can't upload it to github because of the size.

AI training code is in autodarts_training.ipynb. 

I also wrote in more detail how this works. In the repo its called paper.pdf
The paper is not 100% finished and probly will never be hence the [TODO] sections.

Hopfully this project helps anyone wanting to make the same project too.
